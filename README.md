God of War: Over the Years.

God of War family tree inspired by the final installation of the video game franchise. 
I love the game, and based on my knowledge on the game, at the moment, this is the entirety of the characters I find relevant to the plot.

In all, when going about the R code, you should be able to get something close to a family tree between the families associated with the God of War, Kratos. 

If you have any recommendations, then I would greatly appreciate any input from anyone. This would be considered my first project uploaded on GithHub. 

Enjoy :)
